We will go from the basics of how to load and look at a dataset in pandas (python) for the first time, and begin the process of preparing data for analysis. The topics covered are: - Load and look at slices and views of data - Groupby aggregates to summarize data - Tidy and reshape data - Write functions and apply them to data - Plotting data using Seaborn - Encode dummy variables to prepare for analysis and model fit - Fitting a model using sklearn By the end of this tutorial, you should have a solid foundation on working with datasets in Python. The last topic of encoding dummy variables segues into using other libraries, such as scikit-learn and statsmodels to fit models on your data.\n\nTutorial information may be found at https://www.scipy2019.scipy.org/tutorial-participant-instructions\nSee the full SciPy 2019 playlist at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GcDQblpQ_M1V3PQPoLWiDAC\n\nConnect with us!\n*****************\nhttps://twitter.com/enthought\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Enthought/\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/enthought",

        "description": "This talk will present a new approach to dimension reduction called UMAP. UMAP is grounded in manifold learning and topology, making an effort to preserve the topological structure of the data. The resulting algorithm can provide both 2D visualisations of data of comparable quality to t-SNE, and general purpose dimension reduction. UMAP has been implemented as a (scikit-learn compatible) python library that can perform efficient dimension reduction, scaling out to much larger datasets than t-SNE or other comparable algorithms (see http://github.com/lmcinnes/umap).\n\nSee the full SciPy 2018 playlist here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gd-tNhm79CNMe_qvi35PgUR",
