# marimo Pair Programming Protocol

This skill gives you full access to a running marimo notebook. You can read
cell code, create and edit cells, install packages, run cells, and inspect
the reactive graph — all programmatically. The user sees results live in their
browser while you work through bundled scripts or MCP.

## Philosophy

marimo notebooks are a dataflow graph — cells are the fundamental unit of
computation, connected by the variables they define and reference. When a cell
runs, marimo automatically re-executes downstream cells. You have full access
to the running notebook.

- **Cells are your main lever.** Use them to break up work and choose how and
  when to bring the human into the loop. Not every cell needs rich output —
  sometimes the object itself is enough, sometimes a summary is better.
  Match the presentation to the intent.
- **Understand intent first.** When clear, act. When ambiguous, clarify.
- **Follow existing signal.** Check imports, `pyproject.toml`, existing cells,
  and `dir(ctx)` before reaching for external tools.
- **Stay focused.** Build first, polish later — cell names, layout, and styling
  can wait.

## Prerequisites

### How to invoke marimo

Only servers started with `--no-token` register in the local server registry
and are auto-discoverable — starting without a token makes discovery easier.
If a server has a token, set the `MARIMO_TOKEN` environment variable before
calling the execute script (avoids leaking the token in process listings). The
right way to invoke marimo depends on context (project
tooling, global install, sandbox mode). See
[finding-marimo.md](reference/finding-marimo.md) for the full decision tree.

**Do NOT use `--headless` unless the user asks for it.** Omitting it lets
marimo auto-open the browser, which is the expected pairing experience. If the
user explicitly requests headless, offer to open `http://localhost:<port>`
in their browser (`open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux, `start` on Windows).

## Troubleshooting

### `SyntaxError` or `ImportError` from `execute-code.sh`

Code runs **inside the running marimo kernel** — `execute-code.sh` POSTs it
over HTTP and never invokes a local Python. So errors here are not caused by
the local Python version, missing venv, or `uv` vs `pip` — they're problems
with the code being sent. Fix the code (use a heredoc for anything
multiline; don't try to one-line compound statements with `;`).

### User keeps getting prompted to allow Bash commands

The skill declares `allowed-tools` in its frontmatter, but Claude Code may
still prompt for each Bash call. To fix this, the user should add the absolute
paths to the scripts to their `.claude/settings.json` (project-level) or
`~/.claude/settings.json` (global):

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(bash /absolute/path/to/skills/marimo-pair/scripts/discover-servers.sh *)",
      "Bash(bash /absolute/path/to/skills/marimo-pair/scripts/execute-code.sh *)"
    ]
  }
}
```

## How to Discover Servers and Execute Code

Two operations: **discover servers** and **execute code**.

| Operation | Script | MCP |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| Discover servers | `bash scripts/discover-servers.sh` | `list_sessions()` tool |
| Execute code | `bash scripts/execute-code.sh -c "code"` | `execute_code(code=..., session_id=...)` tool |
| Execute code (multiline) | `bash scripts/execute-code.sh <<'EOF'` | same |
| Execute code (by URL) | `bash scripts/execute-code.sh --url http://localhost:2718 -c "code"` | same (with `url` param) |

Scripts auto-discover sessions from the local server registry. Use
`--port` to target a specific server when multiple are running,
`--session` to target a specific session when multiple notebooks are
open on the same server, or `--url` to skip discovery and connect to a
server by URL (e.g. `--url http://localhost:2718`). **On Windows, prefer
direct `--url` when registry discovery is empty** — see the next section
for why. Set the `MARIMO_TOKEN` env var to authenticate when the server
has token auth enabled (`--token` flag also works but exposes the token
in process listings). If the server was started with `--mcp`, you'll
have MCP tools available as an alternative.

### Discovery finds nothing but the user has a server running?

Only `--no-token` servers are in the registry. If discovery comes up empty,
the server likely has token auth — ask the user for the token and set it as
the `MARIMO_TOKEN` environment variable.

On **Windows (Git Bash / MSYS2)**, discovery can also come up empty even for
a running `--no-token` server. If the user confirms marimo is reachable
locally, fall back to `--url http://127.0.0.1:<port>` (ask for the port).

### No servers running?

**Always discover before starting.** Background task "completed" notifications
do not mean the server died — check the output or run discover first.

If no servers are found, read the user's intent — if they want a notebook,
start one. **Always start marimo as a background task** (using
`run_in_background` on the Bash tool) so the server automatically gets cleaned
up when the session ends and doesn't block the conversation. See
[finding-marimo.md](reference/finding-marimo.md).

If there's no `.py` file yet, pick a descriptive filename based on context
(e.g., `exploration.py`, `analysis.py`, `dashboard.py`). Don't ask — just
pick something reasonable.

**Avoid shell escaping issues.** `-c` works for simple one-liners, but for
multiline code or code with quotes/backticks/`${}`, use a heredoc or a file:

```bash
# heredoc (single-quoted delimiter prevents shell interpolation)
bash scripts/execute-code.sh <<'EOF'
import marimo._code_mode as cm

async with cm.get_context() as ctx:
    ctx.create_cell("x = 1")
EOF

# file
bash scripts/execute-code.sh /tmp/code.py

# target a specific port (skips auto-selection when multiple servers run)
bash scripts/execute-code.sh --port 2718 -c "1 + 1"
```

## Executing Code

Every execute-code call runs inside the notebook's kernel. All cell variables
are in scope — `print(df.head())` just works. Nothing you define persists
between calls (variables, imports, side-effects all reset), but you can freely
introspect the notebook: inspect variables, test code snippets, check types
and shapes. Use this to explore, prototype, and validate before committing
anything to the notebook — then create cells to persist state and make results
visible to the user.

To mutate the notebook's dataflow graph — create, edit, and delete cells,
install packages, and run cells — use `marimo._code_mode`:

```python
import marimo._code_mode as cm

async with cm.get_context() as ctx:
    cid = ctx.create_cell("x = 1")
    ctx.packages.add("pandas")
    ctx.run_cell(cid)
```

You **must** use `async with` — without it, operations silently do nothing.
All `ctx.*` methods are **synchronous** — they queue operations and the
context manager flushes them on exit. Do **not** `await` them.

The kernel supports top-level `await`, so use `async with` directly. Do
**not** wrap calls in `async def main(): ...` + `asyncio.run(main())` — it's
unnecessary and easy to get wrong (compound statements like `async with`
can't follow `def name():` on the same line, so cramming it into a `-c`
one-liner produces a `SyntaxError`).

**Cells are not auto-executed.** `create_cell` and `edit_cell` are structural
changes only — use `run_cell` to queue execution.

`code_mode` is a tested, safe API for notebook mutations — prefer it for all
structural changes. You also have access to marimo internals from the kernel,
but treat that as a last resort and only with high confidence after exploration.

**UI state lives outside the reactive graph.** Anywidget traitlets can be read
or set directly (e.g., `slider.value = 5`). For `mo.ui.*` elements, use
`ctx.set_ui_value(element, new_value)` inside `code_mode`.

### First Step: Explore the API

The `code_mode` API can change between marimo versions. Explore it at the
start of each session — dig deeper into anything you're unsure about.

```python
import marimo._code_mode as cm
help(cm)
```

## Guard Rails

Skip these and the UI breaks:

- **Install packages via `ctx.packages.add()`, not `uv add` or `pip`.**
  The code API handles kernel restarts and dependency resolution correctly.
  Only fall back to external CLIs if the API is unavailable or fails.
- **Custom widget = anywidget.** For bespoke visual components, use anywidget
  with HTML/CSS/JS. Composed `mo.ui` is fine for simple forms and controls.
  See [rich-representations.md](reference/rich-representations.md).
- **NEVER write to the `.py` file directly while a session is running — the kernel owns it.**
- **No temp-file deps in cells.** `pathlib.Path("/tmp/...")` in cell code is a bug.
- **Avoid empty cells.** Prefer `edit_cell` into existing empty cells rather
  than creating new ones. Clean up any cells that end up empty after edits.
- **Don't worry about cell names.** Most cells don't need explicit names —
  see [notebook-improvements.md](reference/notebook-improvements.md#cell-names).

## Widgets and Reactivity

Anywidget state (traitlets) lives outside marimo's reactive graph. To hook a
widget trait into the graph, pick one strategy per widget — never mix them:

- **`mo.state` + `.observe()`** — you pick specific traits to bridge. Default choice.
- **`mo.ui.anywidget()`** — wraps all synced traits into one reactive `.value`. Convenient but coarser.

Read [rich-representations.md](reference/rich-representations.md) before wiring either.

## Keep in Mind

- **The user is editing too.** The notebook can change between your calls —
  re-inspect notebook state if it's been a while since you last looked.
- **Deletions are destructive.** Deleting a cell removes its variables from
  kernel memory — restoring means recreating the cell and re-running it and
  its dependents. If intent seems ambiguous, ask first.
- **Installing packages changes the project.** `ctx.packages.add()` adds
  real dependencies — confirm when it's not obvious from context.
