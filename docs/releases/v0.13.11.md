## Version 0.13.11

This release includes improvements to the CI workflow for building Python packages, specifically integrating the MCP documentation database into the build process and optimizing the build steps.

### New Features

- Integrated the MCP documentation database into the Python package build process, ensuring that the database files are included in the final package. This change includes a new verification step to check for the existence of database files before the package is rebuilt. (f7293d0) (Eric Ma)
- Refactored the release-python-package workflow to build the Python package only once after the MCP database is built, removing redundant build steps and updating the documentation to reflect this change. (daeb731) (Eric Ma)
