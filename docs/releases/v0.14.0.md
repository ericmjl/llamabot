## Version 0.14.0

This release introduces significant enhancements to the AgentBot with the implementation of the ReAct pattern, improves test reliability, and updates dependencies.

### New Features

- Implemented the ReAct pattern for AgentBot, replacing the previous logic with a structured reasoning and action framework, enhancing transparency and decision-making processes. (470b1a2) (Eric Ma)

### Bug Fixes

- Updated tests to use the local Llama 3.2 model, simplifying assertions and removing complex mocking that was causing failures. (551251f) (Eric Ma)
- Mocked ToolBot LLM calls in AgentBot tests to ensure tests run fast and reliably without external dependencies. (424d7e9) (Eric Ma)
- Further refined mocking strategies in AgentBot tests to ensure all tests pass without requiring real LLM calls, improving test coverage for the ReAct pattern. (dddbe4c) (Eric Ma)

### Deprecations

- Complete replacement of the previous AgentBot implementation with the new ReAct pattern, removing the planner_bot logic. (470b1a2) (Eric Ma)
