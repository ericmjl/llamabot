## Version 0.13.10

This release introduces enhancements in documentation, testing, and CI/CD workflows, along with the addition of new server capabilities for LlamaBot documentation.

### New Features

- Introduced a new MCP server for LlamaBot documentation, which includes a FastMCP server with a docs_search tool, pre-built LanceDB database, and new CLI commands for building and launching the server. This feature also integrates MCP database build into the CI/CD workflow and supports a specific installation pattern. (ecad5ba) (Eric Ma)

- Improved the test coverage for the docstore build in the CLI by adding mocks for external dependencies and verifying the creation and appending of documents in the docstore. (81ce01c) (Eric Ma)
- Enhanced the test_build_docstore function to use Python's tempfile.TemporaryDirectory for better handling of temporary directories and files, ensuring automatic cleanup and reducing manual maintenance. (892c1db) (Eric Ma)
- Updated the .gitignore file to include the LanceDB documentation database directory, preventing unnecessary tracking of files created during CI/CD processes. (eba1499) (Eric Ma)
