Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term was coined by John McCarthy in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference.

Types of AI

1. Narrow AI (Weak AI)
   - Designed for specific tasks
   - Examples: Chess-playing programs, voice assistants, image recognition
   - Most current AI systems fall into this category

2. General AI (Strong AI)
   - Human-level intelligence across all domains
   - Can understand, learn, and apply knowledge like humans
   - Still theoretical and not yet achieved

3. Super AI
   - Intelligence that surpasses human capabilities
   - Hypothetical future development
   - Subject of much debate and research

Machine Learning Subfields

Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Examples: Classification, regression
- Applications: Email spam detection, medical diagnosis

Unsupervised Learning  
- Finds patterns in data without labels
- Examples: Clustering, association rules
- Applications: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection

Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Uses rewards and penalties
- Applications: Game playing, robotics, autonomous vehicles

Deep Learning
- Uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers
- Inspired by human brain structure
- Applications: Image recognition, natural language processing
